10. **[Deployment Guide](./operations/deployment.md)** - Production deployment

## üîê Security Mindset

As a gambling platform handling real money, security is our top priority. Every decision should consider:

### Security Questions to Ask

- **Input Validation**: "Is this input validated on both client and server?"
- **Authentication**: "Can only authorized users access this?"
- **Data Integrity**: "Could this operation be manipulated or cause inconsistency?"
- **Error Handling**: "Does this error message leak sensitive information?"
- **Rate Limiting**: "Could this endpoint be abused?"

### Red Flags to Watch For

- ‚ùå Using user input without validation
- ‚ùå Skipping authentication checks
- ‚ùå Exposing internal error details
- ‚ùå Missing rate limiting on public endpoints
- ‚ùå Direct database queries without parameterization

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### Daily Development Process

1. **Start of Day**:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   bun run check  # Verify everything works
   ```

2. **Feature Development**:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # Make changes following our standards
   bun run check && bun run lint
   git commit -m "feat: descriptive commit message"
   ```

3. **Before Submitting PR**:
   ```bash
   bun run check     # TypeScript compilation
   bun run lint      # Code style
   bun run build     # Production build test
   bun run preview   # Test production build
   ```

### Code Review Process

**When Submitting PRs**:

- Write clear descriptions explaining what and why
- Include screenshots for UI changes
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Verify security implications
- Update documentation if needed

**When Reviewing PRs**:

- Focus on security and correctness first
- Check for code style consistency
- Verify tests cover important cases
- Ensure documentation is updated

## üéÆ Understanding Our Games

### Provably Fair System

Our games use cryptographic methods to ensure fairness:

```typescript
// Every game result is generated like this:
const result = HMAC_SHA256(serverSeed, clientSeed + nonce);
```

**Key Concepts**:

- **Server Seed**: Random, hashed before game
- **Client Seed**: User-provided randomness
- **Nonce**: Prevents replay attacks
- **Verification**: Players can verify any result

### Game Types

1. **Dice Game**: Roll 0-99.99, bet over/under target
2. **Coin Flip**: Cat vs Dog, 50/50 with house edge

Both games follow the same security and fairness principles.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Patterns

### Component Structure

```
components/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/           # Generic reusable components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ game/         # Game-specific components
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ self/         # App-specific components
```

### API Pattern

```typescript
// All API routes follow this pattern:
export const POST: RequestHandler = async (event) => {
	// 1. Authentication
	// 2. Rate limiting
	// 3. Input validation
	// 4. Business logic
	// 5. Error handling
};
```

### Database Transactions

```typescript
// Critical operations use transactions:
const result = db.transaction((tx) => {
	// All operations are atomic
	// Either all succeed or all fail
});
```

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### What to Test

**Security Features**:

- Authentication and authorization
- Input validation edge cases
- Rate limiting behavior
- CSRF protection

**Game Logic**:

- Provably fair calculations
- Balance updates
- Edge cases (insufficient funds, etc.)

**API Endpoints**:

- Happy path functionality
- Error handling
- Security controls

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Type checking
bun run check

# Linting
bun run lint

# Unit tests (when implemented)
bun run test

# Integration testing
bun run build && bun run preview
```

## üö® Common Pitfalls

### Security Pitfalls

1. **Client-Side Validation Only**

   ```typescript
   // ‚ùå Never trust client-side validation alone
   if (clientValidation.valid) {
   	// Process request
   }

   // ‚úÖ Always validate on server
   const serverValidation = validateOnServer(input);
   if (!serverValidation.valid) {
   	return error(400, serverValidation.error);
   }
   ```

2. **Missing Authentication**

   ```typescript
   // ‚ùå Forgetting authentication checks
   export const POST = async (event) => {
   	const data = await event.request.json();
   	// Process without checking auth
   };

   // ‚úÖ Always check authentication first
   export const POST = async (event) => {
   	const { user } = await validateSession(event);
   	if (!user) return unauthorized();
   	// Continue with authenticated logic
   };
   ```

### Performance Pitfalls

1. **Missing Database Transactions**

   ```typescript
   // ‚ùå Race condition possible
   const user = await getUser(id);
   await updateBalance(id, user.balance - amount);

   // ‚úÖ Atomic transaction
   db.transaction((tx) => {
   	const user = tx.getUser(id);
   	tx.updateBalance(id, user.balance - amount);
   });
   ```

2. **Inefficient Queries**

   ```sql
   -- ‚ùå Missing indexes, inefficient
   SELECT * FROM bet WHERE user_id = ? ORDER BY created_at DESC;

   -- ‚úÖ Proper indexing
   CREATE INDEX idx_bet_user_created ON bet(user_id, created_at);
   ```

## üéì Learning Resources

### Internal Resources

- **Code Comments**: Most complex logic is well-documented
- **Git History**: See how features were implemented
- **PR Reviews**: Learn from feedback on past changes
- **Team Knowledge**: Ask questions in team chat

### External Resources

- [SvelteKit Documentation](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs)
- [Drizzle ORM Docs](https://orm.drizzle.team/)
- [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) - Security best practices
- [SQLite Documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html)

## ü§ù Team Culture

### Communication

**Ask Questions**: No question is too basic when it comes to security
**Share Knowledge**: Document solutions you find
**Collaboration**: Code review is learning, not criticism
**Security First**: When in doubt, choose the more secure option

### Best Practices

- **Commit Early and Often**: Small, focused commits
- **Document Decisions**: Explain why, not just what
- **Test Thoroughly**: Especially security-related changes
- **Monitor Production**: Watch for issues after deployment
